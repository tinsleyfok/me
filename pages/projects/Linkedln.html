            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p class="sub">LinkedIn is a business and employment-oriented service that operates via website and mobile apps. The profile page that I needed to redesign is for job seekers posting their CVs in order to build professional networks and ultimately get the jobs they wanted, as well as for recruiters to find better employees.
            </p><br /> <br />
            <h2>IDEATION</h2>
            <p class="sub">In order to be successful in this redesign, I spent two days doing thorough interviews of diverse users of LinkedIn, identifying what is not working too good. I also looked into the usability of various features and identified the features users want the most and the features they consider as meaningless or distracting.
            </p>
            <img src='../../images/linkedin/userinterview.png'>
            <p class="sub">97% of users never noticed the dashboard feature <br />
                93% of users used LinkedIn for job seeking <br />
                90% of users don’t use the social media function <br />
                67% of users wanted to check for commonality between their own profile and others <br />
                60% of users think the profile page content is too crowded<br />
                57% of users love to see who reviewed their profile page recently
                <br /> <br />
                <h2>TARGET AUDIENCE</h2>
                <p class="sub">I started my research by categorizing two types of users that would browse the profile page. The first group of audience is job seekers who share their profiles to find jobs or look at others’ profile pages to gain information. The second group of audience is recruiters who want to find good employees. Below is the persona that was created base on my in-depth research.

                <br /> <br />



                <h2>DESIGN GOALS</h2>
                <p class="sub"> Based on the insights from users, I plan to improve the usability and visuals by adding and modifying some elements. </p>
                <p class="sub">
                    • Create new UI design that is professional, clear and simple<br />
                    • Redesign the "career interest" function user flow<br />
                    • Add a side menu that navigate through various experiences<br />
                    • Create simple data visualization of dashboard, skills, and connections<br />
                    • Downsize the social feed feature<br />
                    • Add "Similar Profile" section when visiting others’ user profiles<br />
                </p><br /><br />

                <h2>Career Interest</h2>
                <p class="sub">
                   Many are unaware that users are able to selectively turn on the "career interest" function that lets recruiters know you're open. However, the profile page does not accurately show whether a user is actively seeking and the position that he or she is looking for. Through interviews with users, I found that those who are looking for a job are eager to make their career intentions clear on the profile page. I redesigned the profile page based on the above observation. For users who have the “career interest” function enabled there will be a blue circle around their profile picture to indicate that they are looking for a job. And by hovering the profile picture, the job positions they are currently seeking will be displayed.

                <br /><br /><br />
                <h2>Side Menu</h2>
                <p class="sub">
                   Some users have rich experiences, but that often leads to profile pages that are too long and filled with too much text making people browsing the them fatigue. Hence, I created a side menu to make better use of space.
                </p>
                <img src='../../images/linkedin/sidemenu.gif'>
                <br /><br /><br />
                <h2>Similar Profile</h2>
                <p class="sub">
                    I found that users would love to be able to look for similar profiles of the ones they are currently browsing. Therefore, I decided to add a feature called "similar profile" on the right side.
                </p>
                <img src='../../images/linkedin/similarprofile.png'><br /><br /><br />
                <h2>Simple Data Visualization</h2>
                <p class="sub">
                    I asked various LinkedIn users and 97% of them did not notice there is a dashboard that informs them the number of people that looked at their profile, the number of people that read their post and the number of companies they searched for within the week. Users don’t really care about these data as well, except for a few that think how many people visited their profile is somewhat important. Hence, I redesigned to move the dashboard from right under the description to the side of the page.  <br /><br />
                    Furthermore, the profile page has too much text and I think it would be a good idea to add some graphic elements. Hence, I decided to make some simple data visualization for not only the number of visitors but also Skills, In Common, and Connection sections.

                <p class="sub"> <br /><br />
                    <h2>UI GUIDELINE</h2>
                    <p class="sub"> The profile picture and logo itself have many colors. In order to keep the page clean and tidy, I did not add any other colors except the original Linkedin blue. For the header and footer, I chose a little bit darker gray, which makes the whole feeling of the site more professional, clear and simple.</p>
                    <img src='../../images/linkedin/ui.png'>
                    <br /> <br />
                    <h2>UI/UX STAGE</h2>
                    <p class="sub"> There are slightly different bewteen users own profile page and others profile page. Users can edit their own profile page, see their private dashboard and can choose to open "career interest" feature, while browsing others profile page, users can find the common with the profile ower, see how to connect with the profile owner and check similar profile. </p>
