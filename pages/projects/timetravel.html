            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p class="sub">
                This is a digital speculative time-travel booking experience that operates via App and website. The project is still ongoing. It should be done within one week. If you want to check the fully functional website version, please come back in one week. I explain its ideation, research support and technical execution below. On this project, I also aim to explores how playfulness and gamification could be used on for other kind of product beyond video game. <br /><br />
            </p>
            <h2>INSPIRATION</h2>
            <p class="sub">Playfulness and gamification can be employed not only in video games, but also in other kinds of products to create a delightful and memorable experiences for users. Features that make games engaging can also make other kinds of products more enjoyable, meaningful and memorable, strengthen usersâ€™ future positive actions and ultimately increase the quality of overall user experience and the market value of a product. In my work, I add playful features that usually applied to games to a speculative booking system, in order to design joyous and remarkable interface and user experience.<br /><br />

            The booking service is designed based on previous theoretical framework called The Playful Experience (PLEX). I test out different frameworks, in order to find features that can make my experience more delightful and engaging.
            </p><br /><br />

            <h2>PLEX FRAMEWORK</h2>
            <p class="sub">The PLEX framework came out of careful research. The researchers interviewed users for many times about their feelings and understanding of the scenes and experiences of the game, and observed users' feelings through everyday gadgets use, such as mobile phones, digital cameras and music player. Finally, 22 categories were set in Playful Experience Framework. From a design point of view, the researchers also want to explore whether the PLEX framework could be used to design for playfulness beyond video games.  <br /><br />
            
            I choose 6 frameworks from PLEX framework, including humor, fellowship, fantasy, thrill, control and discovery. I want to apply these frameworks to my booking experience and test out if these frameworks are able to increase the playfulness of my product. Below is a table that show how the experience I designed follow the PLEX framework</p>
