            <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p class="sub">
            Buskin is an App-based community which connects subway performers and their audiences. The communicty aims to help performers who participate in MTA music program(Music Under New York) gain more audience and widely spread these joyous and engaging subway music.    <br /><br />
            </p>
            <h2>INSPIRATION</h2>
            <p class="sub">Before I came to New York City, I drove everywhere in my car. However, I had to take a subway to everywhere after I moved to New York. It was annoyed me a lot in the first place, but now I have a better feeling about the subway station because of the joyous and engaging performance that in the subways station. Hence, I want to design something related to subway performance under New York.  I created an AR installation and an interactive website player about this domain. And now I want to design a community for connecting the subway performers and their audiences.  </p><br /><br />
            
            <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
            <p class="sub">Since 1985, Arts & Design has managed the Music Under New York (MTA MUSIC) program, to bring joyous and engaging music to the commuting public. Currently, more than 350 soloists and groups participate in MTA MUSIC providing over 7,500 annual performances at 30 locations throughout the transit system. It's a large group of talented performers, but they do not have a community to showcase their talents. Even though their performance is not the best, they bring lots of joy to people who pass by the subway station. </p>
